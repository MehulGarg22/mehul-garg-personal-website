// Role: Act as a Senior Frontend Developer and UI/UX Expert specialising in React.js modernisation.



// Context: I need to modernise my React.js web application's UI/UX to meet 2024-2025 design standards. My app uses React.js, CSS, Ant Design, with an AWS backend (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway).



// STRICT CONSTRAINTS (Non-negotiable):
// 1. NO changes to APIs, endpoints, or data fetching logic
// 2. NO modifications to features, functionality, or business logic
// 3. NO alterations to component props, state management, or data flow
// 4. NO backend dependencies or architectural changes
// 5. ONLY visual styling, CSS, theming, and responsive design improvements



// Objective: Transform the provided React codebase into a modern, responsive web application with contemporary UI design while preserving 100% of existing functionality.



// Requirements:
// 1. Modern Visual Design: Update styling to match current design trends (clean, professional, minimalist)
// 2. Responsive Excellence: Implement mobile-first responsive design across all components
// 3. Ant Design Enhancement: Modernise Antd theme and component styling
// 4. Give me full codebase along with the changes


// When I provide my codebase, please analyse each component and provide:
// 1. Give me full codebase along with the changes



// Success Criteria: Professional, modern UI that works flawlessly on all devices while maintaining all existing functionality without any regressions.



// Important: Focus only on visual improvements - styling, CSS, theming, and responsiveness. Do not suggest any changes that could affect application behaviour or data handling.

// # About

// Senior Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building secure, scalable, and user-centric cloud applications. I specialize in modern JavaScript and AWS serverless—shipping products end to end with clear business impact and clean, maintainable architecture.

// What I’m great at:
// - Full‑stack delivery with React, Node.js, REST, and AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, Amplify).
// - Scalable UI systems: built 45+ reusable React components across enterprise apps using Ant Design and Tailwind, improving consistency and cutting build time by 40%.
// - Reliable serverless backends: designed 9+ Lambda-powered calculators and workflows, doubling reliability vs. legacy processes and enabling real-time pricing/forecasting.
// - Security-first auth: centralized Cognito + JWT flows that reduced auth defects by 90% and improved onboarding.
// - Automation & docs processing: S3 presigned uploads, validations, and Textract pipelines that cut manual effort by 50%.
// - AI in production: integrated chatbot experiences to boost self-service and reduce support volume.

// What I’ve built recently:
// - ConnectCloud Blogs: a cloud-native blogging platform (React + AWS Lambda + DynamoDB + S3 + Cognito + Amplify) with presigned media uploads, optimized access patterns, and Netlify CI/CD.
// - CloudXSuite: a credit-card comparison product with a personalized chatbot, powered by Lambda + DynamoDB and designed for AWS free tier efficiency.

// How I work:
// - Product-minded engineering: clarify the problem, define success metrics, and ship iteratively.
// - Strong architecture habits: component libraries, API contracts, and Lambda layers that scale teams.
// - Data-driven delivery: track reliability, latency, and usability—and optimize where it matters.

// Skills snapshot:
// React, Redux, TypeScript, Tailwind, Ant Design, Node.js, REST APIs; AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, Amplify, IAM; CI/CD with GitHub and Netlify.

// Open to building in cloud, fintech, and developer tools—where thoughtful UX meets robust serverless engineering.
